# Big-Bang-Theory-walkthrough
lets try to execute sheldon1 file. It says it is a bomb and we need to defuse it. If we type anything while the program running the bomb will explode. We must reverse engineer it to understand and defuse it. Type “gdb sheldon1” then type “info functions” to see the functions of the program.it has lot of them. Some of them are created specially for the program. Ex: secret_phase, explode_bomb, phase_defused, phase_1
